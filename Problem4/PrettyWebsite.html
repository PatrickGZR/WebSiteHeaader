                    Big and powerful, but responsive and fun to drive. Gas mileage is very good for this class of SUV. 
                    Cargo space, though limited by the size of the hybrid battery, is ample for normal family needs. 
                    Multimedia display is great. Plenty of towing capacity for a 23 foot Airstream...

                    The first SUV I've ever had. I'm also a salesman, so I've driven a lot of SUVs. In my opinion, 
                    it's smooth and roomy with enough tech to satisfy 99.9% of people. Also, it's going to hold its value 
                    very well which made stomaching the massive MSRP a little easier...

                    I took my wife's Lexus for regular maintenance service and the dealer had a 2023 Sequoia Limited

                            2023 Sequoia: Our expert's take

                <p>
                    Big, bold and extremely comfortable, the tank-like 2023 Toyota Sequoia is a solid, 
                    family-pleasing SUV with a couple of curious quirks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It’s as big as rivals from Ford and GM, but the Sequoia’s hybrid powertrain compromises 
                    the two main reasons to own a full-size SUV, resulting in a truck with inferior 
                    third-row comfort and cargo space.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The 2023 Toyota Sequoia is new from the ground up — a bigger, flashier, more sophisticated 
                    full-size SUV than the one it replaces. It shares its greasy bits with the Toyota Tundra pickup, 
                    the Lexus LX full-size luxury SUV and the newest Toyota Land Cruiser, which is no longer sold 
                    in the U.S. That means the Sequoia benefits from all the Tundra’s and LX’s significant improvements,
                     including new, more efficient engines and a far more upscale interior.

                    <p><a>
                        There’s no mistaking the new Sequoia for anything but a Toyota, given its close familial resemblance 
                        to the new Tundra. It’s big, bold and exactly what most full-size SUV buyers want and expect from such 
                        a massive ride. It is also, however, very tank-like, inside and out — the beltline is high, with squat 
                        windows all around and a low-feeling roof, combined with chunky fenders and a huge grille.

                        The 2023 Sequoia is an entirely new design from the wheels up. 
                        The prior model was designed in 2008, so the big SUV was overdue for an update.
                        It also has two sets of tires to fill. It takes over for the old Sequoia, of course. 
                        But it also becomes the only large SUV on Toyota sales lots, as Toyota has pulled the legendary 
                        off-road Land Cruiser from its American lineup this year. There’s a new Land Cruiser overseas. 
                        But Toyota elected not to sell it in America.</a></p>

                    <header><a><b>Ultra-Luxe Trim</b></a></header>
                    <p><a>
                        Materials quality has made a huge leap forward, with even the lower-spec Limited 
                        I drove impressing with sharp-looking textures, high-quality leather, and solid-feeling buttons 
                        and switches. There are some real differences between trim levels, as well; 
                        things get progressively nicer as you go up the lineup, culminating in the opulent Capstone edition, 
                        which sports real wood trim. Given the Sequoia is something of a premium product, 
                        it starts with nicer bits than the Tundra pickup upon which it’s based, and it shows.
